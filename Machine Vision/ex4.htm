</h5>Exercise 4: Morphological Image Processing</h5>

<p>Matlab's help has a chapter about morphology - search for "Morphological Operations".

<p><ol>
<li>
<p>
Get
<a href="figs/broken-text.tif">an image with broken characters</a>. 
Use <font face="courier">imdilate</font> to dilate the image.
The maximum length of the breaks is known to be two pixels.
</p>

<p><table><tr><td><img src="figs/image012.gif"/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Dilated broken characters image</td></tr></table>

<li>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>
The thin lines connecting the center region to border pads have to be removed
from <a href="figs/wirebond-mask.tif">a binary image of a wirebond mask</a>.
The other structures have to be preserved.
This can be done by choosing a structuring element small enough to fit within
the center square and thicker border leads, but too large to fit
entirely within the wires. Erode the wires using a suitable structuring element.
After that, restore the center square and thicker border leads to their original
size using dilation with the same structuring element.

Perform the same operation using morphological opening (<font face="courier">imopen</font>)
with the same structuring element.

</ol>

Consider <a href="figs/blobs_in_circular_arrangement.tif">an image</a> showing 
a region of small circles enclosed by a region of larger circles.
(This exercise is easier to solve if you first complement 
the original image using <font face="courier">imcomplement</font>.)
The image has two textural regions: the one composed of large blobs and
the other composed of smaller blobs. Find the boundary between the two
regions based on their textural content. Use morphological operations 
(opening and closing) for
removing small blobs and combining large blob area into one combined area as<br>
<img src="figs/image006.gif" /><br>
The boundary can be found with morphological gradient (= the difference between the
dilation and the erosion).
