</h5>Exercise 5: Spatial filtering</h5>

<p>
In these exercises, two source images are used: 
<a href="figs/ckt-board-slt-pep.tif">an industrial circuit board</a> corrupted by
salt-and-pepper noise,
and a slightly blurred image of the <a href="figs/moon.tif">North Pole of the Moon</a>.
</p>

<p><ol>

<li><p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>
Median filter the circuit board image (<font face="courier">medfilt2</font>).
Experiment with different filter sizes. What happens when the median
filter size increases? Check also how different image padding methods
(zero-padding and symmetric padding) affect on filtering.
</p>

<li><p>
Matlab's help for <font face="courier">colfilt</font> shows an example
of mean filtering 
(<a href=http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/images/ref/colfilt.html>web help</a>). 
Mean filter the circuit board image; try also
max and min filters.
For what purposes might these filters be useful?
</p>
</ol>

<li><p>
Matlab function <font face="courier">edge</font> can be used for edge
detection. Find the edges from the circuit board image;
use both Sobel and Laplacian of Gaussian methods. Repeat the exercise for median and
mean filtered images. In your opinion, which combination produces the best result?
</p>

<li><p>
The general image filtering command in Matlab is <font face="courier">imfilter</font>,
and predefined filters can be created with <font face="courier">fspecial</font>.
Sharpen the Moon image
by using a suitable filter. Does sharpening enhance the circuit board image?
